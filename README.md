# Tego : Technology Lego Block 

This repository is something which makes my learning curve smooth for the XR Open Source fellowship project. I would be learning a new technical lego block and implement it into one mono project. This is solely for personal learning and should include only much amount of code to make my life a bit easier. The goal is not to make some fancy design or use case of the software. But, Still I am keeping this open because, If someone wants to learn or leverage similar tech stack for project You are most welcome to fork, learn, implement or even contribute if you want to.
